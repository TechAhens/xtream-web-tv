# üì∫ Xtream Web TV

Web application built with Node.js and Bootstrap for streaming live channels from an Xtream Codes playlist.

- The goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for browsing bouquets and channels, allowing you to quickly find and play your desired channel.
- An Xtream Codes account is required. This application does not provide any streaming sources.
- Only live TV is supported‚Äîmovies and series are not included.
- The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Users can customize their experience by choosing which bouquets to display and enabling or disabling Picons. An electronic program guide (EPG) is also available.
- The project uses hls.js as the player, which supports Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode for an enhanced viewing experience.
- Note: Due to browser codec limitations and potential HTTP/HTTPS conflicts, some streams may not be playable.
